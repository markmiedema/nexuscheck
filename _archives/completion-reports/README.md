## Why These Were Archived

**Reason 1: Terminology Clarity**
- These reports refer to "Sprint 1" (core app build)
- New planning uses "Sprint 1" for different features
- Archiving prevents confusion between old and new "Sprint 1"

**Reason 2: Historical vs. Current**
- These are point-in-time completion reports
- Current status is documented in `_05-development/CURRENT_STATUS_2025-11-05.md`
- Archiving separates historical milestones from current status

**Reason 3: Preservation**
- Important historical records worth preserving
- Document significant achievements
