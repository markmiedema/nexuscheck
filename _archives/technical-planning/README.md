# Archived Technical Planning Documents

**Created:** 2025-11-11
**Purpose:** Historical reference for pre-development planning and design documents

This folder contains technical planning documents that were created BEFORE development to guide implementation. These documents described the INTENDED architecture and design, which has now been implemented in the production application.

## Files Archived

### PHASE_2B_SCREEN_SPECIFICATIONS_PLANNING.md
- **Original Creation Date:** 2025-11-03
- **Superseded by:** Actual implementation in production application
- **Purpose:** Original UX/screen design specifications
- **Content:** 1,117 lines
  - 7-screen MVP flow specifications
  - Detailed wireframes and screen layouts
  - Form fields and validation rules
  - User flow diagrams
  - Error handling patterns

**Why Archived:**
- This was a **planning document** created before development
- Described the INTENDED design
- Most specifications were implemented in the production app
- However, actual implementation includes enhancements not in original spec:
  - Analysis management features
  - Smart column mapping with auto-detection
  - Enhanced date range detection
  - Additional UX improvements
- Better preserved as historical reference showing original design vision

**Archived During:** Technical specs audit (2025-11-11)

**Historical Value:**
- Shows original UX design decisions and rationale
- Useful for understanding "why" behind certain design choices
- Reference for comparing planned vs. actual implementation
- Documents the user-centered design process

**Current Status:** The production application is deployed and operational with features based on (but enhanced beyond) these specifications. See `_05-development/CURRENT_STATUS_2025-11-05.md` for actual feature status.

## Why Keep These?

These planning documents are preserved for:
- **Historical Reference:** Understanding the design evolution from planning to implementation
- **Design Decisions:** Documenting the "why" behind architectural choices
- **Comparison:** Seeing what was planned vs. what was built
- **Learning:** Reference for future similar projects
- **Context:** Understanding the thought process during initial planning
