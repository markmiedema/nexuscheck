    <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <div class="data-card">
        <h4>Nexus Determination</h4>
        <p class="text-small">
            Economic nexus is determined based on each state's revenue and/or transaction thresholds.
            Physical nexus is determined based on reported physical presence (employees, property, etc.)
            in each state. Once nexus is established, it typically remains in effect until the business
            formally withdraws from the state.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-1">Liability Estimation</h4>
        <p class="text-small">
            Estimated tax liability is calculated using each state's combined state and average local tax rates
            applied to taxable sales. Interest is calculated from the estimated nexus date using state-specific
            rates and compounding methods. Penalties are calculated based on each state's late filing and
            late payment penalty structures.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-1">VDA Savings Calculation</h4>
        <p class="text-small">
            VDA (Voluntary Disclosure Agreement) savings are estimated based on typical penalty waivers
            offered by each state. Most states waive penalties entirely through VDA programs; some also
            offer reduced or waived interest. The savings shown represent the estimated penalty amounts
            that would be waived through a VDA.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-1">Filing Frequency</h4>
        <p class="text-small">
            Recommended filing frequency is based on typical state requirements for sellers with similar
            sales volumes. Actual requirements may vary based on state-specific rules and thresholds.
            Monthly filing is typically required for high-volume sellers ($1M+ annual taxable sales),
            quarterly for mid-volume ($100K-$1M), and annual for lower-volume sellers.
