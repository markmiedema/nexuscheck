    <h3 class="mt-2">Methodology</h3>
    <div class="data-card">
        <h4>Nexus Determination</h4>
        <p class="text-small">
            Economic nexus is determined based on each state's revenue and/or transaction thresholds.
            Physical nexus is determined based on reported physical presence (employees, property, etc.)
            in each state.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-1">Liability Estimation</h4>
        <p class="text-small">
            Estimated tax liability is calculated using each state's combined state and average local tax rates
            applied to taxable sales. Interest and penalties are calculated from the estimated nexus date
            using state-specific rates and methods.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-1">VDA Savings Calculation</h4>
        <p class="text-small">
            VDA (Voluntary Disclosure Agreement) savings are estimated based on typical penalty waivers
            offered by each state. Most states waive penalties entirely through VDA programs; some also
            offer reduced or waived interest.
