## The Problem

SALT (State and Local Tax) professionals who leave Big 4 firms for boutique agencies face a critical infrastructure gap:

- They lose access to expensive enterprise tax software
- They're forced into manual processes for everything
- Enterprise tools cost $50k+/year - prohibitively expensive for small agencies
- Manual work dramatically increases engagement time and reduces profitability

### The Pain Point

A typical **3-4 year lookback nexus analysis** (nexus determination + liability estimation):
- Takes **12-20 hours** of manual work
- Clients pay **$5,000-$25,000** per engagement
- Most of this time is spent on repetitive data processing, not high-value analysis

---

## The Solution

Build affordable automation tools that:
- **Reduce processing time from 12-20 hours to minutes**
- Maintain 90-95% accuracy (human-in-the-loop for review)
- Cost a fraction of enterprise tools
- Work with their existing workflows (Excel-based)
- Handle the heavy lifting while they focus on analysis and client service

---

## Target Value Proposition

**For SALT professionals:**
"Automate 11-19 hours of tedious work on engagements you charge $5k-$25k for, giving you time to take on more clients or deliver deeper analysis."

**Key benefit:** Tool pays for itself on a single engagement.

1. Economic nexus determination (state-by-state)
2. Physical nexus tracking
3. Marketplace facilitator rule application
4. Multi-year liability estimation

## Why This Matters

### For the Professional:
- More engagements per month (capacity increase)
- Higher profit margins (less time per engagement)
- Better work-life balance (less tedious work)
- Competitive advantage (faster turnaround)

### For Their Clients:
- Lower costs (less billable hours)
- Faster results
- Consistent quality

### Market Opportunity:
- Boutique agencies can't afford $50k/year tools
- Manual processes limit growth
- No mid-market solution exists
- Target users are technically comfortable but not developers

---

## Long-Term Vision

Expand beyond nexus analysis to automate the full SALT workflow:
- VDA preparation
- Registration applications
- Return filing
- Ongoing monitoring and alerts
- Audit support documentation

Build a platform that makes boutique agencies as efficient as Big 4 firms, without the Big 4 price tag.
