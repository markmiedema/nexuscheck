## Primary User Profile

### Background
- **Previous role:** SALT tax professional at Big 4 or large firm
- **Current role:** SALT professional at boutique agency (typically 2-20 person firm)
- **Specialization:** Sales tax compliance (economic nexus, VDA, filing, audit defense)
- **Client base:** Wide range of industries including e-commerce, SaaS, manufacturers, distributors

### Why They Left Big Firms
- Sought better work-life balance
- Wanted more autonomy and client relationships
- Attracted to smaller agency culture
- Opportunity for partnership or ownership

### Current Pain Points
- **Lost infrastructure:** No access to expensive Big 4 tools
- **Manual processes:** Everything done in spreadsheets
- **Time constraints:** Limited bandwidth to take on more clients
- **Cost barrier:** Enterprise tools cost $50k+/year (prohibitive for boutique agencies)
- **Competitive pressure:** Need to deliver Big 4 quality without Big 4 resources

## Technical Proficiency

### Comfortable With:
- Microsoft Excel (advanced formulas, pivot tables, data manipulation)
- PDF form filling and document creation
- Web-based applications (SaaS tools)
- Email and cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- State tax portals and e-filing systems

### NOT Comfortable With:
- Writing code (Python, SQL, etc.)
- Command line interfaces
- Complex technical configurations
- Database management
- API integrations

**Key insight:** They're power users of business software but not developers. Think "advanced Excel user" not "software engineer."

## Workflow Context

### Typical Engagement Flow:
1. Client reaches out (often after receiving nexus letter or preparing for transaction)
2. Initial consultation and scoping call
3. Data collection from client (sales data, business structure info)
4. Analysis (nexus determination, liability estimation) â† **12-20 hours here**
5. Report preparation and client presentation
6. Follow-up services (VDA, registration, filing)

### Current Tools:
- **Excel** - Primary analysis tool
- **Google Sheets** - Client data collection
- **Manual research** - State tax websites, Bloomberg Tax, Thomson Reuters
- **Word/Google Docs** - Report creation
- **Email** - Communication
- **State portals** - Registration and filing

### Pain Points in Current Workflow:
- Data cleaning and standardization takes hours
- Manually checking nexus thresholds state-by-state
- Looking up tax rates and rules for 45+ states
- Creating professional reports from scratch each time
- Tracking dates and deadlines across multiple clients

## Decision-Making Criteria

### What They Value:
- **Time savings** - Their time is billable at $150-300/hour
- **Accuracy** - Errors damage client relationships and create liability
- **Professional output** - Reports must look polished for clients
- **Ease of use** - No time to learn complex software
- **Fair pricing** - Willing to pay but not enterprise prices
- **Reliability** - Can't risk tool failures mid-engagement

### What They Don't Care About:
- Cutting-edge technology for its own sake
- Bells and whistles they won't use
- Integration with tools they don't use
- Customization beyond their needs

### Buying Decision:
- **ROI calculation:** Will this pay for itself on a single engagement?
- **Risk assessment:** Is this reliable enough to use with real clients?
- **Ease of adoption:** Can I start using this today or does it require setup/training?

## Use Case Priorities

### High Priority (Will Pay For):
1. **Nexus analysis automation** - Biggest time sink
2. **Liability estimation** - Direct client deliverable
3. **Report generation** - Professional output matters
4. **Data handling** - Clean and process messy client data

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have):
5. VDA preparation assistance
6. Registration form automation
7. Compliance monitoring/alerts
8. Return preparation

### Lower Priority (Future):
9. Audit support documentation
10. Client portal/sharing
11. Team collaboration features
