## Contents

### [DEEP_RESEARCH_PROMPTS.md](./DEEP_RESEARCH_PROMPTS.md)
**Purpose:** Structured prompts for researching state interest and penalty rates

**Use Case:**
- Batch research for all 50 states
- Deep Research / Claude with web search
- Verify and update database rates

**Organization:** 10 states per batch (5 batches total)

### [INTEREST_PENALTY_RATE_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md](./INTEREST_PENALTY_RATE_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md)
**Purpose:** Template for documenting state-specific interest and penalty rate research

**Use Case:**
- Research individual state rates
- Document calculation methods (simple, compound monthly, compound daily)
- Track sources and verification dates
- Ensure accurate database entries

## When to Use These

**Before Production:**
- Phase 2 interest/penalty rates are placeholders
- Must research actual rates from state DOR websites
- Use these templates to systematically gather data
- Update database with verified rates

**Ongoing Maintenance:**
- States occasionally change rates
- Annual verification recommended
- Document rate changes and effective dates
